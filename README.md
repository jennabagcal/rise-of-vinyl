<h1>The Rise of Vinyl: Behind the Scenes of Making a Record</h1>
<h3>BY SETRIGE CRAWFORD AND JENNA BAGCAL</h3>
<h4>The Process:</h4>
<p>The idea for this project came from something that I was working on for Cultural Issues. I examined the cost to make vinyl records at Brooklyn Vinyl Works, one of two vinyl pressing plants in New York State. After talking to Will Socolov, the owner of the pressing plant, my interest in the subject grew, and I wanted to delve deeper into the topic.</p>

<p>According to data from Statista, the sales of vinyl records have been steadily on the rise since the early 90's. There have been countless stories done from the buyer's perspective: why consumers choose vinyl over digital mediums is a topic we feel has been done to death. But there haven't been many stories written about vinyl from the production side. Which is why we thought that this topic would make for a fresh story.</p>

<p>Initially, we had trouble narrowing down our focus. We wanted to focus on all sides of vinyl and show how the increasing popularity was affecting all sides: buyer, seller, creator and artist. But we found that that focus was too broad. We ended up narrowing our focus to the production side and wanted to show the behind the scenes of how a record is made.</p>

<p>We visited Brooklyn Vinyl Works and met with Will Socolov and his staff at his Brownsville factory. We filmed video and took pictures of the entire process from start to finish.</p>
